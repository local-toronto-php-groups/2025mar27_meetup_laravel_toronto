We have confirmed the re-scheduling of Chris Sevilleja's Laravel Cloud demo + Q&A for March 27th.

This will be along the lines as we did with our November meet-up with Jess Archer for Laravel's Nightwatch.  

A very special thank you to Taylor and the Laravel Cloud team for making this happen. 

Although this meet-up is in-person only, Chris will join us remotely. 

Schedule:

- 6:00pm to 7:00pm: meet-and-greet
- 7:00pm to 9:00pm: Laravel Cloud demo + Q&A
